# Travel Companion

This web application allows users to simulate the cultural experience of traveling while we're all stuck at home in quarantine.

Based on a user input (either searching for a specific place, asking for a random city, or using their current location), the application shows recommendations across different categories to give the user a feel for the culture of that place. Current recommendations include books (using the Goodreads API), movies (using the Open Movie Database API), art (using the Harvard Art Museums API), and news (using the New York Times API). The user's location is found using the Google Maps API.

The application is designed and styled using the Materialize CSS Framework, and uses images/backgrounds from Getty, freepik.com, and VectorStock.com.
